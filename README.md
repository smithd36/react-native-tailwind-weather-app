# react-native-tailwind-weather-app
This is a mobile application using React Native, Tailwind CSS and WeatherAPI. The app provides a seamless user-interface, functional features, such as wind speed, 7 day forecast and location based real-time weather. This project was very fun and educational, and taught me about API integrations and Mobile App development with modern technologies.
